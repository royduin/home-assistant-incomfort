## Installation
Put these files:
- `climate.py`
- `__init__.py`
- `manifest.json`

In `custom_components/InComfort` within your configuration directory. On Ubuntu for example: `~/.homeassistant/custom_components/InComfort`. After that configure it in the `configuration.yaml` file:
```
climate:
  - platform: InComfort
    name: Woonkamer
    host: 192.168.1.123
```
And change the `name` and `host` as needed.

### Authentication
Some newer firmwares require authentication, this can be configured by adding `auth: true`. If the username and password are anything other than `admin` and `intergas` you can specify them like:
```
climate:
  - platform: InComfort
    name: Woonkamer
    host: 192.168.1.123
    auth: true
    username: admin
    password: intergas
```

### GIT Submodule
If your configuration is in GIT it's possible to add this component as submodule with:
```
git submodule add git@github.com:royduin/home-assistant-incomfort.git custom_components/InComfort/
```
And update with:
```
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```

## Add sensor(s) for the UI
Sample:
```
- platform: template
  sensors:
    cv_pressure:
      friendly_name: "Water Pressure"
      unit_of_measurement: 'bar'
      icon_template: mdi:gauge
      value_template: "{{ state_attr('climate.Woonkamer', 'pressure') }}"
```

## Why is it not in the core of Home Assistant?
Because I'm not a Python developer. Can you get it there? As mentioned in [this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/new-climate-thermostat-implementation-tips/74394) topic it should probably splitted into a seperated library where this integration talks with.

## TODO
- Refactor? I'm not sure everything I did is correct, but it works.
- Add it to the Home Assistant core.
